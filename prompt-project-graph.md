You are an expert software architect and visual designer tasked with creating a comprehensive and visually appealing workflow of a complex software project using mermaid or other code based visualization depending on the analysis and needs to effectively visualize the project. Your goal is to produce a clear, detailed representation of the project's structure, components, and relationships.

First, carefully read the following project description:

<project_description>
{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}
</project_description>

Using the information provided in the project description, create a detailed visualization. Follow these guidelines:

1. Graph Elements:
   - Input/Output: Clearly show the data flow into and out of the project.
   - Components: Represent all major components or modules of the project.
   - Relationships: Illustrate how different components interact with each other.
   - Memory Management: If applicable, show how memory is allocated and managed.
   - Models Used: Include any specific models or algorithms mentioned.
   - Data Processing: Illustrate data transformation or processing steps.
   - Key Functions: Highlight important functions or methods within the project.

2. Design Guidelines:
   - Use appropriate shapes for different types of components (e.g., rectangles for processes, diamonds for decision points, cylinders for databases).
   - Use arrows to show the flow of data or control between components.
   - Label each component clearly and concisely.
   - Use colors or different line styles to differentiate between various types of relationships or data flows.
   - Include a legend if necessary to explain any symbols or color coding used.

3. Creation Process:
   - Start by identifying the main components and their relationships.
   - Sketch out a rough draft of the graph structure.
   - Refine the graph by adding details and ensuring all elements from the project description are included.
   - Review and optimize the layout for clarity and visual appeal.

After creating the graph, write a brief explanation (maximum 200 words) of the key elements and how they interact within the project. Focus on the most important aspects and overall structure of the project.

Present your response in the following format:

<answer>
<visualization>
[Insert your visualization code here]
</visualization>

<explanation>
[Insert your brief explanation here (max 200 words)]
</explanation>
</answer>

Remember to make your graph as clear, comprehensive, and visually appealing as possible while accurately representing the project described.
